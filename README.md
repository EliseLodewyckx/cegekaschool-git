# Merge Exercise
We're working on our `fugufusion` branch, which holds a recipe to use in a Fusion kitchen.

You're job is to get your current changes in the `master` branch.
And you want to first pull whatever important changes are in the `master` branch, like - I dunno - a recipe that actually **doesn't** kill anyone?

But look out, some guy that started the `ratings` branch, accidentally started his work from our `fugufusion` branch.

Apparently he discovered his whoopsie too late and decided to revert our commits! 

The devious bastard then merged his branch with `master` and deleted his own temporary feature branch.

## Exercise 1
Don't hide his mistakes and accept that it's ok to revert his reverts of our commits.

## Exercise 2
Try hiding his mistake(s)
